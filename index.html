                    Dearest Brendan,</p>
                    <p>
                    California is hot. And it has earthquakes, fires, and endless traffic on the 405. But all of this will be worth it when you&rsquo;re not flying red eyes to teach a day of class and can come home to your family.  A little change is good and Otis is lucky to have you at the helm. New York will always have a special place in our journey.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for all the phone calls checking in on my sanity, for quickly answering emails when I didn't know where a file was, and for reminding me why we do this crazy thing of teaching.</p> 

                    <p>Three wishes for you:<ul>
                    <li>May all your pizzas be delivered to the right place and time.</li>
                    <li>May you get a faculty team who are as smart, hardworking, and inspiring as at Parsons.</li> 
                    <li>And lastly, may you get a chance to breathe and take it in once your boxes are unpacked&nbsp;â€”&nbsp;look at the hot pink sunset and say you&rsquo;re home.</li></p></ul>

                    Sending love from the UK,
                </p>
