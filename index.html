                    <p>Dearest Brendan,</p>
                    <p>California is hot. And it has earthquakes, fires, and endless traffic on the 405. But all of this will be worth it when you’re not flying red eyes to teach a day of class and can come home to your family. A little change is good and Otis is lucky to have you at the helm. New York will always have a special place in our journey.</p>
                    <p>Thank you for all the phone calls checking in on my sanity, for quickly answering emails when I didn&rsquo;t know where a file was, and for reminding me why we do this crazy thing of teaching.</p> 
                    <p>Three wishes for you:
                        <ul>
                            <li>May all your pizzas be delivered to the right place and time.</li>
                            <li>May you get a faculty team who are as smart, hardworking, and inspiring as at Parsons.</li> 
                            <li>And lastly, may you get a chance to breathe and take it in once your boxes are unpacked — look at the hot pink sunset and say you’re home.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Sending love from the UK,</p>

                    <p>You are a rockstar, and Otis is so lucky to have you trail blaze the future its program. THANK YOU for all you’ve done for Parsons. You made MPS CD the amazing program it is. I&rsquo;m so grateful for your friendship (going all the way back to grad school when we were spring chickens)! Know you always have a place to stay and a welcome crew to organize dinner whenever you find yourself visiting NYC. :) I send big hugs to you and the fam!</p>

                    <p>You will be greatly missed, and Parsons CD won’t be the same without you! I’ve always appreciated your sense of humor and sharp &ldquo;positive sarcasm&rdquo; in and outside of meetings.</p>
                    <p>I hope life brings you back to New York — or even better, to Cologne, so we can end the workday at 3pm with a celebratory beer.</p>
                    <p>Be well and stay in touch!</p>

                    <p>Congratulations on breaking free. You’re going to crush it at Otis and they are so lucky to have you. Don’t forget to stay super humble. Thank you for being the best colleague and for your support this past year. I will keep you posted on the absurdities that will continue to occur here so don’t worry about feeling left out. Let’s Go Brendan!</p>

                    <p>From ten years ago, when I sat in my first Core Interaction meeting with you as the coordinator, until last year, at our Visual Culture Seminar final crit at Squarespace with you as the MC — you’ve been the same: constantly championing other people and making good things happen. It’s been a pleasure teaching alongside you and I’m grateful for all your support. Wishing you the sickest audio setup and an unlimited woven lanyard budget. You better let us know when your tour dates drop.</p>

                    <p>Hello Brendan,</p>
                    <p>Congratulations on your new appointment at Otis! You are well positioned to be in this new post and I can imagine the new ideas you will be implementing there. Good luck with your move to “SoCal” and warm wishes to Azusa and your boys as you get adjusted to your new environment. I’ll be in touch when my travels take me to your fair city. Many members of the Tenazas clan are based there so I’ll have other reasons to visit! Good luck!</p>

                    <p>I’m soo thankful that I got to work alongside you these last seven years. I have learned so much from you as a colleague and am grateful that I can now call you a good friend. From seeing your gamer mouse, crazy keyboard, insane sneakers to your bright orange MPS CD lanyard, getting to sit next to you in the AMT hub has been a special treat. For all the jokes cracked while getting down in the trenches to help shape the CD program into what it has become today, you have left your mark here at Parsons without a doubt. Lastly, your support this year has been everything. I am sooo excited for my next trip out to Los Angeles and I wish you best of luck as you start this new chapter at Otis!</p>

                    <p>It’s been such a full-circle experience since meeting in Brian Watterson’s Core Interaction class to developing the Core Interaction curriculum together as full-time faculty. Parsons CD won’t be the same without your vivacious spirit, unfiltered meeting commentary, and thoughtful ideas! I’m very grateful for our friendship and can’t wait to hear about your new chapter in Los Angeles. Best wishes to you and your family. <span class="small">&hearts;</span></p>
